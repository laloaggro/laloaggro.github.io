# Notion + VSCode Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate Notion with VSCode for better workflow and documentation.

## Recommended Extensions

The following extensions are recommended for better Notion integration:

1. **REST Client** - For testing Notion API endpoints directly from VSCode
2. **Markdown All in One** - For better Markdown editing experience similar to Notion
3. **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** - For tracking project issues that can be synced with Notion

## VSCode Settings for Notion Integration

The `.vscode/settings.json` file includes configurations that optimize VSCode for Notion-like editing:

- Format on save enabled for consistent formatting
- Optimized Markdown preview settings
- REST Client environment variables for Notion API

## Tasks for Notion Integration

The `.vscode/tasks.json` file includes several tasks that can help export data to Notion:

1. **Export project structure for Notion** - Creates a file tree that can be copied to Notion
2. **Export TODOs for Notion** - Extracts all TODO, FIXME, and NOTE comments from the codebase
3. **Export documentation for Notion** - Lists all Markdown files that can be synced with Notion

## Using the REST Client with Notion API

To use the Notion API with the REST Client extension:

1. Create a `.env` file in your project root with your Notion API key:
   ```
   NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_api_key_here
   ```

2. Create `.http` files to make requests to the Notion API:
   ```http
   ### Get database
   GET https://api.notion.com/v1/databases
   Authorization: Bearer {{NOTION_API_KEY}}
   Notion-Version: 2022-06-28
   ```

## Syncing Documentation with Notion

You can use the export tasks to generate documentation that can be manually copied to Notion:

1. Run `Export documentation for Notion` task to list all Markdown files
2. Review and update your Notion pages with the latest documentation
3. Use the `Export TODOs for Notion` task to track technical debt in Notion

## Best Practices

1. Keep your Notion documentation in sync with your codebase
2. Use consistent naming conventions between VSCode and Notion
3. Regularly export TODOs and technical debt to Notion for tracking
4. Use the REST Client extension to test Notion API integrations
